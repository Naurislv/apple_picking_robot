# Based on this repo: 

https://github.com/CentroEPiaggio/irobotcreate2ros.git

For our case, we needed to download it and place in ros src, then add it to existing world.

## Prerequisites:

* [ros serial](http://wiki.ros.org/serial)
* [ros joy](http://wiki.ros.org/joy)

## Launch

`source devel/setup.bash`
`export iRobot_model="iRobot"`

`roslaunch irobotcreate2 irobot_dbaby_world.launch`

---

If you change something in URDF file, before compiling you should recreate a new SDF model:
cd Â¬/irobotcreate2ros/model

`source generate_model.sh`


`./run_apple_picker.sh -r true -w  dbaby -gg true -t true`
