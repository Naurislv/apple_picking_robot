# Robotic Operating System

It is not operating system but more like software framework to simplify robot development which can be installed in Docker or Linux (Ubuntu recommended) operating system.

Available lecture videos about ROS can be downloaded [here](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/54lppt8w7pfbg90/AAAiSUkj0A7eIN2Ap1UbOyB9a?dl=0).

# Basics

## Motivation

Many components of robotic systems may researchers, engineers and practitioners built from scratch over and over because of that ROS idea was born. Instead of repeating those steps ROS tools and environment right away. Not to mention huge community with tons of code available.

## ROS Components

Robot may be Drone, Car, Robotics arm or other and they have similar basic architecture.

![ros_project_architecture](images/ros_project_architecture.png)

### 1. ROS Master

Contains all necessary information of all active ROS nodes on system which allows other nodes to discover each other as well as parameters (configuration parameters).

### 2. Nodes

Entities of ROS blocks which contains certain functionality.

### 3. Messages

ROS support different types of messages which could be send between nodes such as Physical Quantities (Positions, Velocities, Accelerations, ..), Sensor Readings (Laser Scans, Images, Point Clouds, Measurements, ..).

Number of message types available are more than 200 but you can define your own message type if needed however it is recommended to search for already defined message types before defining your own.

### 4. Topics

Pub-Sub architecture.

Nodes can share messages with one another using Topics which is named bus e.g. /my_topic.

Node sending message to topic is called __Publishing___.
Node receiving message from topic is called __Subscribing__.

Messages are send directly from node to node without interacting with ROS Master.

### 5. Services

Request-Response architecture.

Similar to topics except can be called when needed instead of continuously publishing or subscribing to a topic which may result in less overhead.

Does not use publisher or subscriber like Topics but instead create service at a node by defining request and response.

## Compute Graph

Is a graph consisting of all Nodes, Services and Topics to represent systems architecture.

More info: http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_graph

## Debugging

Displaying images using rqt:

1. Run your ROS software
2. Run `roscore` from terminal, if it is not already running
3. Run `rqt_image_view` from terminal. GUI should pop up and then just choose right topic.

Find more info: http://wiki.ros.org/rqt_image_view

## Setup ROS

There are many tutorials how to setup ROS so we will not go into details but rather point out some issues we had.

1. Don't give up on first failure. Keep trying and looking for an answer. It should work but at the start it may be frustrating. We've all been there.
2. ROS using Python 2 by default and from our experience it should stay in that way. If you are using Python 3 then ROS may not run correctly as you must use Python 2 defined in System Paths. It's worth checking ~/.bashrc for that.
3. Virtual Machines are great but won't be able to GPUs so before creating Virtual Machine make sure you won't need GPU in future.
4. Rather than setting up individual environments for ROS use Git so environment for all would be same configure.

## Catkin workspace

### Catkin packages

ROS software is organized and distributed into packages, which are directories that might contain source code for ROS nodes, libraries, datasets, and more. Each package also contains a file with build instructions - the CMakeLists.txt file - and a package.xml file with information about the package. Packages enable ROS users to organize useful functionality in a convenient and reusable format.

### Catkin workspaces

A catkin workspace is a top-level directory where you build, install, and modify catkin packages. The workspace contains all of the packages for your project, along with several other directories for the catkin system to use when building executables and other targets from your source code.

### Roslaunch

When you want to start a ROS software you usually start it with launch file like this: `roslaunch launch/file.launch`. This brings up ROS loop and start all nodes described in launch file. These launch files usually bring up a set of nodes for the package that provide some aggregate functionality. This launch file can point to single node launch files and configuration files.

### Adding new package

In Catkin workspace new package mean new ROS node.

To add new package you must go through following steps (hello world example):

1. Define the path to package `.launch` file in `./ros/launch/project.launch` for example:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <launch>
        <!--Hello World node -->
        <include file="$(find hello_world)/launch/hello_world.launch"/>
    </launch>P
    ```

2. Create `hello_world` package directory: `./ros/src/hello_world/`
3. Create `launch` directory in `hello_world`: `./ros/src/hello_world/launch`
4. Add simple script in `hello_world.py` which you want to be run in `./ros/src/hello_world/`:

   __!NB__ Every single python script must be executable (change permission for script in your file system) and start with `#!` declaration at the top.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env python

    """Simple ROS Catkin workspace package (node) example."""

    # Standard imports
    import time

    # Dependency imports
    import rospy

    class HelloWorld(object):
        """Traffic Light detection and classification. Results publishing to ROS nodes."""

        def __init__(self):
            rospy.init_node('hello_world')
            rospy.loginfo('Init hello_world')
            print('Hello Apple Picking Team. Congratulations for running ROS project for first time.')

            self.loop()

        def loop(self):
            """
                Loop function to publish waypoints for car to follow
            :return:
            """
            rate = rospy.Rate(10) # 10Hz

            i = 0
            while not rospy.is_shutdown():
                i += 1
                rospy.loginfo('Loop iter: %d', i)
                rate.sleep()

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        try:
            HelloWorld()
        except rospy.ROSInterruptException:
            rospy.logerr('Could not start hello_world node.')
    ```

4. Add `hello_world.launch` in `./ros/src/hello_world/launch` and define it to run `hello_world.py`:

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <launch>
        <node pkg="hello_world" type="hello_world.py" name="hello_world" output="screen" cwd="node"/>
    </launch>
    ```

5. Add `package.xml` in `./ros/src/hello_world/` and describe package (note that most lines are commented):

    Here you can define which packages this package depends on but not only, please read through example. Packages provided here are already existing in ROS but you also can define here that hello_world package depends on e.g. goodby_world package in same src directory.

    ```
    <?xml version="1.0"?>
    <package>
      <name>hello_world</name>
      <version>0.0.0</version>
      <description>Hello world package</description>

      <!-- One maintainer tag required, multiple allowed, one person per tag -->
      <!-- Example:  -->
      <!-- <maintainer email="jane.doe@example.com">Jane Doe</maintainer> -->
      <maintainer email="yousuf@todo.todo">yousuf</maintainer>


      <!-- One license tag required, multiple allowed, one license per tag -->
      <!-- Commonly used license strings: -->
      <!--   BSD, MIT, Boost Software License, GPLv2, GPLv3, LGPLv2.1, LGPLv3 -->
      <license>TODO</license>


      <!-- Url tags are optional, but multiple are allowed, one per tag -->
      <!-- Optional attribute type can be: website, bugtracker, or repository -->
      <!-- Example: -->
      <!-- <url type="website">http://wiki.ros.org/waypoint_loader</url> -->


      <!-- Author tags are optional, multiple are allowed, one per tag -->
      <!-- Authors do not have to be maintainers, but could be -->
      <!-- Example: -->
      <!-- <author email="jane.doe@example.com">Jane Doe</author> -->


      <!-- The *_depend tags are used to specify dependencies -->
      <!-- Dependencies can be catkin packages or system dependencies -->
      <!-- Examples: -->
      <!-- Use build_depend for packages you need at compile time: -->
      <!--   <build_depend>message_generation</build_depend> -->
      <!-- Use buildtool_depend for build tool packages: -->
      <!--   <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend> -->
      <!-- Use run_depend for packages you need at runtime: -->
      <!--   <run_depend>message_runtime</run_depend> -->
      <!-- Use test_depend for packages you need only for testing: -->
      <!--   <test_depend>gtest</test_depend> -->
      <buildtool_depend>catkin</buildtool_depend>
      <build_depend>geometry_msgs</build_depend>
      <build_depend>roscpp</build_depend>
      <build_depend>rospy</build_depend>
      <build_depend>sensor_msgs</build_depend>
      <build_depend>std_msgs</build_depend>
      <build_depend>styx_msgs</build_depend>
      <build_depend>waypoint_updater</build_depend>
      <run_depend>geometry_msgs</run_depend>
      <run_depend>roscpp</run_depend>
      <run_depend>rospy</run_depend>
      <run_depend>sensor_msgs</run_depend>
      <run_depend>std_msgs</run_depend>

      <!-- The export tag contains other, unspecified, tags -->
      <export>
        <!-- Other tools can request additional information be placed here -->

      </export>
    </package>
    ```

6. Add `CMakeLists.txt` in `./ros/src/hello_world` (note that most lines are commented):

    Here you can define which packages this package depends on but not only, please read through example. Packages provided here are already existing in ROS but you also can define here that hello_world package depends on e.g. goodby_world package in same src directory.

    ```
